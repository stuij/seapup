- when loading page, input hash string into terminal
- add hashlink change knowledge in ajax responses
- update hashlink when typing text/only-blog-names on user-interface
- add comments to posts in backend
- add make-comment link and machinery

- decorate blogposts with the usual things like time
- decorate blog listings to be a bit more enticing
- favicon
- blog post dissimination: rank by tag
- history of input commands, triggerable with 'up' button
- fallenfrukt posts have gotten date from incorrect field
- seapup sbcl-bin and add to upstart or whatever du-jour process manager

laterish:

- in post objects, go from text-representation to proper localtime timestamp
- put 'next' button under blog posts. Damn readable blog I have.
- put eliza-rules.lisp in content and have something more generic
for rule-sets (the idea being that seapup will explore some domain sometimes)
- add sessions
-- add context-sensitivity
-- add conversation choices
- think of punctuation processing conundrum
- add user-support
- searching/indexing of text
- rss support?
- hunchentoot output feedback to repl when firing form web-page [later me: ?]
